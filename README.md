# Autonomous_Vehicle_Controller
## Project Summary
The purpose of this project is to autonomously control a robot as it travels around a track and returns license plates and parking IDs of parked cars (all within Gazebo). Points are given for each correct license plate returned and the completion of the first lap. Points are deducted for violations of traffic laws (driving off the road and collisions with vehicles and pedestrians), with the team with the most points at the end of a four-minute run being the victors.

## Implementation
### Driving controller

### License plate detection

## Installation
To setup the ROS environment, follow the installation guide [here](ROS_environment/README.md)
